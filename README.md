Siti is awesome


Programming language of the old guard, Java,
With your verbose syntax and need for semi-colons,
You keep us entertained, even as we struggle to get our code to compile.

Your tendency to throw exceptions at the most inopportune times
Makes us chuckle, even as we curse your name.
And your love for long, winding class names
Makes us appreciate the moments when our code actually runs without a hitch.

Despite your quirks, Java, we still love you,
For without you, many of our favorite apps wouldn’t exist.
You bring stability and reliability to the world of software development,
And make it possible for us to build complex systems with ease.

So here’s to you, Java, our trusty, verbose old friend,
May your quirks continue to make us laugh, until the very end.
